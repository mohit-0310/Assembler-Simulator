This is our group's (Group B-3) source code for an assembler based on the ISA and assembly mentioned in the Project Assignment.

This includes taking an input as various assembly lines or instructions and printing the machine code of each instruction as output.

The assembler reads the assembly program as standard input and generates the machine code as standard output.

All sort of possible errors like typos in instruction name, undefined labels,variables and other possible errors are taken care of by printing an error line for each 
type of error.
